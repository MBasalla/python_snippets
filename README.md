# python_snippets
This repository contains python code snippets that I found useful over several projects.

Some are more specific (e.g. for filtering sensor data)
while some have a more general use (e.g. turning a list of dictionaries into a dictionary of lists)

As I usually use Python 3 code might not always be backward compatible with python 2.

All these code snippets solve problems that I came across during several coding projects in my PhD research.
They are mostly not original but based on stackoverflow replies or tutorials I found while searching a solution for a specific coding problem.

I tired to provide credit to the original sources everywhere. Should I have missed some let me know and I will try to include them as soon as possible.
